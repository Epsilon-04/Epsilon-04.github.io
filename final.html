      <h1>About</h1><br>
        <p>&emsp;This is our final project for CSC106. This is a madlibs game made by myself and Erich Premier.<br>
          &emsp; It is a khan adaptation of the classic game, madlibs. If you don't know, madlibs is a game where <br>
          &emsp;you get a sentence and put your own words in for nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.<br>
          &emsp; The game is intended for young children ages 6-8 (hence the simplicity of the mad lib).<br>
          &emsp;It repeats because it is supposed to be a song.
